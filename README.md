# chatroom

This is a web-based chatroom project that allowed me to experiment with Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and databases as an introduction to complex web design. 
It is a classic database-oriented application in which users can create unlimited chatrooms (not actually unlimited, rather up to (unicode_length)^16)
and connect and talk to others.
There is a command-line interface embedded in the application which allows simple room customisation, including leaving, closing and locking a room. 
The locking feature also includes an optional password.
